jsgif-render
============

Silly thing to render a GIF in the browser, using either the canvas element or a table.

NOTE: This script requires PHP to handle the file upload. Because of that, you can use it live online at http://mknln.com/o/gif.html to avoid having to run a webserver.

Also, it turns out this thing doesn't work as well as I thought it did, so I would recommend using the GIFs in sample_gifs/ for testing. :)
